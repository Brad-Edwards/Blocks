/// Bucket Sort implementation for sorting slices of floating-point numbers in the range [0, 1).
/// 
/// # Algorithm Overview
/// Bucket sort works by:
/// 1. Creating n empty buckets (where n is the length of the input)
/// 2. Putting each element into its corresponding bucket based on its value
/// 3. Sorting each non-empty bucket (using insertion sort)
/// 4. Concatenating all buckets in order
/// 
/// # Time Complexity
/// - Best Case: Ω(n + k) when elements are uniformly distributed
/// - Average Case: Θ(n + k) when elements are uniformly distributed
/// - Worst Case: O(n²) when all elements go into the same bucket
/// 
/// # Space Complexity
/// - O(n + k) auxiliary space where k is the number of buckets
/// 
/// # Stability
/// - Stable if the underlying sort is stable (insertion sort in this case)
/// 
/// # Advantages
/// - Linear time complexity for uniformly distributed data
/// - Works well with floating-point numbers
/// - Can be parallelized easily
/// - Good cache performance due to locality of reference
/// 
/// # Limitations
/// - Requires uniformly distributed input for best performance
/// - Not in-place sorting algorithm
/// - Requires additional space
/// - Input must be in a known range (typically [0, 1))
