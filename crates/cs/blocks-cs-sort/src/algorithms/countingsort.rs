/// Counting Sort implementation for sorting slices of unsigned integers.
/// 
/// # Algorithm Overview
/// Counting sort works by:
/// 1. Finding the range of input data (min to max)
/// 2. Counting the frequency of each value in the input range
/// 3. Building the cumulative frequency array
/// 4. Placing each element in its sorted position
/// 
/// # Time Complexity
/// - Best Case: O(n + k) where k is the range of input
/// - Average Case: O(n + k)
/// - Worst Case: O(n + k)
/// 
/// # Space Complexity
/// - O(k) auxiliary space where k is the range of input
/// 
/// # Stability
/// - Stable sort algorithm
/// 
/// # Advantages
/// - Linear time complexity when k = O(n)
/// - Excellent for integers with known, limited range
/// - Stable sorting algorithm
/// - Can be used as a subroutine in radix sort
/// 
/// # Limitations
/// - Only works with non-negative integers
/// - Not efficient when the range of input values is much larger than n
/// - Requires extra space proportional to the range of input
