/// Shell Sort implementation for sorting slices.
/// 
/// # Algorithm Overview
/// Shell sort is an optimization of insertion sort that:
/// 1. Starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other
/// 2. Progressively reduces the gap between elements being compared
/// 3. Uses the gap sequence: n/2, n/4, n/8, ..., 1 (other sequences possible)
/// 4. For each gap, performs a gapped insertion sort
/// 
/// # Time Complexity
/// - Best Case: O(n log n) - depends on gap sequence
/// - Average Case: O(n^1.3) - using Knuth's sequence
/// - Worst Case: O(n²) or O(n log² n) depending on gap sequence
/// 
/// # Space Complexity
/// - O(1) auxiliary space
/// 
/// # Stability
/// - Not stable
/// 
/// # Advantages
/// - Simple implementation
/// - Adaptive: runs faster when array is partially sorted
/// - In-place algorithm
/// - Much better than simple insertion sort
/// - Works well for medium-sized arrays
