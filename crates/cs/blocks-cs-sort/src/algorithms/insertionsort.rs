/// Insertion Sort implementation for sorting slices.
/// 
/// # Algorithm Overview
/// Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time by:
/// 1. Starting with the first element as a sorted array of length 1
/// 2. Taking each subsequent element and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted portion
/// 3. Shifting elements as needed to make space for the inserted element
/// 
/// # Time Complexity
/// - Best Case: O(n) when array is already sorted
/// - Average Case: O(n²)
/// - Worst Case: O(n²) when array is reverse sorted
/// 
/// # Space Complexity
/// - O(1) auxiliary space
/// 
/// # Stability
/// - Stable sort algorithm
/// 
/// # Advantages
/// - Simple implementation
/// - Efficient for small data sets
/// - Adaptive: O(n) when data is nearly sorted
/// - In-place: O(1) extra space
/// - Online: can sort a list as it receives it
