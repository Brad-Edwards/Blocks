/// Selection Sort implementation for sorting slices.
/// 
/// # Algorithm Overview
/// Selection sort works by:
/// 1. Dividing the input into a sorted and unsorted region
/// 2. Finding the minimum element in the unsorted region
/// 3. Swapping it with the first element of the unsorted region
/// 4. Moving the boundary between sorted and unsorted regions one element to the right
/// 
/// # Time Complexity
/// - Best Case: O(n²)
/// - Average Case: O(n²)
/// - Worst Case: O(n²)
/// 
/// # Space Complexity
/// - O(1) auxiliary space
/// 
/// # Stability
/// - Not stable by default (equal elements may change relative order)
/// 
/// # Advantages
/// - Simple implementation
/// - Performs well on small arrays
/// - Minimizes the number of swaps (O(n) swaps vs O(n²) comparisons)
/// - In-place algorithm
/// - Works well when memory writes are expensive
