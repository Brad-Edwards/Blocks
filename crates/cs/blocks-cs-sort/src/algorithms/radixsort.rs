/// Radix Sort implementation for sorting slices of unsigned integers.
/// 
/// # Algorithm Overview
/// Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that:
/// 1. Takes each place value (digit) starting from least significant
/// 2. Groups numbers by the value at that digit
/// 3. Collects numbers maintaining relative order within each group
/// 4. Repeats for each digit up to the most significant
/// 
/// # Time Complexity
/// - Best Case: O(d * (n + b)) where d is number of digits and b is the base
/// - Average Case: O(d * (n + b))
/// - Worst Case: O(d * (n + b))
/// 
/// # Space Complexity
/// - O(n + b) auxiliary space where b is the base (typically 10 or 256)
/// 
/// # Stability
/// - Stable sort algorithm
/// 
/// # Advantages
/// - Linear time complexity for fixed number of digits
/// - Stable sorting algorithm
/// - Works well when the range of possible digits is small
/// - Can be faster than comparison-based sorts
/// 
/// # Limitations
/// - Only works with integers or strings
/// - Performance depends on number of digits and base
/// - Uses extra space
